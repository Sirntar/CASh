**This app was never meant to be used in production.** It had only been my personal playground used as a learning environment for C# WPF with NVVM pattern a long time ago. That repository does not contain any previous commits, because it is an updated version from the repository I no longer have.

# Description
The application is used to manage the customer base of a given company via the user's computer by utilizing a Sqlite database.

# License
You can do, whatever you want with this app. So I'm publishing that software under **0BSD** license.
